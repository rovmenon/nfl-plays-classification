# nfl-plays-classification

Predicted football play types during drives based on game features, utilizing ML classifier models on historical play-by-play football data. We streamlined training and testing processes by filtering, cleaning, and transforming necessary columns using Pandas. We implemented a baseline decision tree (based on Down and Yards to Go) to validate play prediction intuition and expanded model accuracy using sklearn library with k-nearest-neighbors, RandomForest, Bagging, Adaptive Boosting, and a Stacking classifier.
